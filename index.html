            <p>Dr Sudhakar Appala was born on September 20,1954 in a village called Dhammannapet,India. His parents (Narasimiah and Soundarya Appala) were so immensely happy that he was a bright student and hardworking. He got married to his loving wife Indira who is so beautiful and always helping grand pa to complete his medicine and Surgery Post Graduation.
                Her help means the whole world to him and what he is today is because of her support.
                My Grandpa always dedicated to his job and commited to his goals he also puts his patients before himself. He also never takes break from his work and is always working hard to achive more because my Grandpa knows if you achive something it does not mean you achieved everything so he always leaves space for improvments. Even though my grandpa is so busy he always makes time for me. That is why my grandpa Dr Sudhhakar Appala is the best docter and Grandpa.
